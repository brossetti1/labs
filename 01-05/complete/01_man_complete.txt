man kill

kill will terminate a process and you can usually use it in situations where a 
process is frozen, taking to long to complete, or maybe you just want to stop 
something from running.

you can see the running processes by using a command like ps aux or top and you 
can use kill by passing it the PID of the process you want to terminate.

here are some optional commands you can pass before the PID:
 1       HUP  (hang up)
 2       INT  (interrupt)
 3       QUIT (quit)
 6       ABRT (abort)
 9       KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
 14      ALRM (alarm clock)
 15      TERM (software termination signal)


You can get a list of all signals by hitting man signal. you can pass kill -signal_name or 
-signal_number to tell kill how to end a specific signal

examples: kill -3 PID or kill -KILL PID
