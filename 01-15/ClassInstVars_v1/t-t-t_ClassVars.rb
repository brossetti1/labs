#
#   In this assignment, we'll revisit and refactor
#   [our previous tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/TIY-ATL-ROR-2015-Jan/labs/tree/master/01-08/questions.md)
#   implementation with an eye towards testability, maintainability,
#   object oriented design, and code quality.
#   
#   ## Objectives
#   
#   ### Learning Objectives
#   
#   After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦
#   
#   * Understand basic OO principles
#   * Appreciate the difficulty of changing code, and think about ways to make it easier
#   * Be comfortable writing tests and structuring code to be testable
#   
#   ### Performance Objectives
#   
#   After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use
#   
#   * `class`es and `module`s to encapsulate logic
#   * `minitest` to write and run tests
